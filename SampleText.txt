 self-introduction explains who you are, what you do and what others need to know about you. You should provide a self-introduction any time you meet someone new and don’t have a third party to introduce you. Offer a self-introduction when you are:

Beginning an interview
Attending a hiring event
Networking with new connections
Giving a presentation
Meeting people at a trade show
A self-introduction should include your name and occupation (or desired occupation) and key facts that will help you make an impression on the person you’re speaking to. In a few sentences, cover the most important things that others need to know about you.
